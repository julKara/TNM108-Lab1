text2 = "Sol has brown hair and eyes, which are sometimes depicted as reddish-brown or golden with slit pupilsâ€”the latter of which is to distinguish his true nature as a Gear. Wearing a red headband bearing the words 'Rock You', Sol keeps his spiky, waist-length hair tied at all times. The headband conceals the red brand on his forehead that would expose him as a Gear. He has muscular physique, whether he is infused with Flame of Corruption or not. As Frederick, he is depicted with either brown or blue eyes; he sports a much shorter hair, a muscular physique and a white labcoat. He wears a tight, black undershirt with the top half covered by a red sleeveless jacket, along with white jeans. His belt buckle has the word 'FREE' scratched on it and a drape of red cloth hanging down beneath. Sol also wears a pair of black fingerless gloves, red shoes, and a multitude of belts, including a lone one on his left bicep. In later games, he is seen sporting long-sleeved, red leather jackets with handcuffs strapped in the sides of the sleeves and a single black accent at the back of his jackets as well."
